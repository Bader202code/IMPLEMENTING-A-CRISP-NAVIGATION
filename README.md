Logic Explanation:

This application involves the Student Registration System, where students can be added, updated, deleted, and their profiles can be viewed. It is designed using Swing for the GUI, JDateChooser for the date input, JTattoo for custom look and feel, and it manages the student data using an in-memory list. Below is a detailed explanation of how things are used and connected in the code.

Components and Their Usage Student Class:

This class represents the student object and holds data such as name, registration number, course, subject, gender, and date of birth. It has a constructor to initialize these properties and getter methods to retrieve them. The toString() method provides a string representation of the student for easy printing. StudentManager Class:

This class manages the list of students. It stores students in an ArrayList. Methods include: addStudent(): Adds a new student to the list. removeStudent(): Removes the student at the current index. updateStudent(): Updates the details of the student at the current index. getNextStudent() and getPreviousStudent(): Navigate through the list of students. printStudents(): Prints details of students (either all or the current one). getStudentByDetails(): Retrieves a student based on their registration number. It uses the CurrentIndex to track the currently selected student in the list. StudentRegistration Class (Main GUI):

Swing Components:

TextFields (JTextField): For input fields like name, registration number, course, and subject. RadioButtons (JRadioButton): For selecting gender (Male or Female). JDateChooser: For selecting the student's date of birth. ComboBox (JComboBox): To list and select students from the student list. Buttons (JButton): For performing actions like submitting, deleting, updating, and viewing student details. Key Functionality:

The form is used to input student details (name, reg number, course, subject, gender, and date of birth). When the Submit button is clicked, the details are collected from the input fields and a new Student object is created and added to the student list. The ComboBox is populated with the names of the students, so the user can select an existing student from the list. Delete Student: Removes the selected student from the list and the ComboBox. View Profile: Displays a dialog with the details of the selected student. List All Students: Displays a dialog with the details of all students. Layout:

The layout of the GUI is managed with GridBagLayout to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness of the components. Each form field is aligned using GridBagConstraints for positioning. Logic Flow:

The user enters the student's details in the text fields and selects a gender. After clicking Submit, the student is added to the list, and the ComboBox is updated with the new studentâ€™s name. The StudentManager class stores the list of students and provides methods to navigate, update, or remove students. The ComboBox allows the user to select a student by name. When selected, the relevant student data is populated back into the form fields for review or update. Delete Student button removes the selected student from both the list and the ComboBox. The View Profile button displays detailed information about the selected student in a dialog box. Key Points of Connection Student Object & StudentManager:

StudentManager uses a list (ArrayList) to manage all Student objects. The addStudent() method in StudentManager creates a new Student and adds it to the list. Methods like getCurrentStudent(), getNextStudent(), and getPreviousStudent() interact with the student list to return a specific student based on the index. Student Registration Form (GUI) & StudentManager:

The StudentRegistration class handles the user interface and user input. When the user submits the form, a new Student object is created and added to both the studentList (for GUI representation) and the StudentManager class (to manage student data in memory). The studentComboBox allows the user to select a student. The selected student's details are populated into the form for viewing or editing. Swing Components & Event Handling:

Submit Button: On click, it gathers data from the form fields and creates a new student, then adds it to the studentList and ComboBox. Delete Button: Deletes the selected student from the studentList and removes their name from the ComboBox. View Profile Button: Displays the details of the selected student in a dialog using JOptionPane. ComboBox Selection: When the user selects a student from the ComboBox, the form fields are updated with that student's data (name, reg no, course, etc.). Look and Feel (JTattoo):

The custom AcrylLookAndFeel from JTattoo is applied to the whole GUI to provide a modern and attractive user interface. This is set in the StudentRegistration constructor using UIManager.setLookAndFeel().
